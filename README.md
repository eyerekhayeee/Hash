## Hash

## Introduction:
 The Contact Manager is a simple Java console application designed to manage a collection of contacts. It uses a Hash to store contacts, where the name acts as the key, and the phone number is the value. This ensures efficient operations for adding, retrieving, and deleting contacts.

## Features:
*Add new contacts with a name and phone number.
*View a specific contact by name.
*Delete a contact by name.
*Display all saved contacts.


## Purpose: 
I created this application to showcase the practical use of Hash for solving real-world problems. It demonstrates efficient contact management, bridging theory and practical implementation for learners.
Helping users store and manage their contacts in an organized manner.

## Contribution to the Community:
 This application helps beginners learn Hash in Java through a simple contact manager. It shows how to use theory in practice and can inspire small projects.
